# Submission lanes, cohorts, and the three guards

A submission run splits in two, and the split is the whole point of the cohort
tags. Both lanes produce work; neither is a leftover.

| | Lane A — unattended | Lane B — staged queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cohorts | `open` | `captcha`, `account-captcha`, `email-verify`, `manual-review` |
| What the driver does | fills, clicks the real submit control, reads the result | fills **everything it is allowed to**, walks to the final step, and **leaves the page open** |
| Ends at | `submitted` / `outcome-unknown` | `staged-captcha` — a form on screen needing a code and a click |
| Who finishes it | nobody | the owner, in one sitting, seconds per site |

The driver never types a CAPTCHA answer, never creates an account, never pays,
and never ticks a terms box — those stop the row and move it to Lane B with
whatever could legitimately be filled already in place.

## Lane B needs one session per staged site

**N staged forms need N session names.** A session owns one tab, so reusing a
single session overwrites the previous staged form and the queue silently
becomes a queue of one — while the report still says N staged. Do not reach for
`tab new` to solve this; see Law 2 in [browser-runtime.md](browser-runtime.md)
for why that API cannot hold several pages.

`scripts/adapter-phpld.mjs` carries the correct pattern:

```js
const sessionFor = (url) => `${base}-${new URL(url).hostname.replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/gi, '-').slice(0, 40)}`;
```

Hand the owner the session list, not a list of URLs to re-enter by hand.

## Run one cohort at a time

Every target carries **all** the gates observed on it in `gates`, and a `cohort`
derived from that set. The cohort is the batch it belongs in, because the
cohorts cost different things:

| Cohort | What the run needs |
| --- | --- |
| `open` | nobody. The only cohort that can run unattended. |
| `captcha` | a human at the keyboard for the whole run |
| `account` | credentials and an identity decision, made **before** the run |
| `account-captcha` | both of the above |
| `email-verify` | a mailbox watched while the run is going; tokens expire mid-batch |
| `reciprocal` | a change to the owner's own site — their decision, never yours |
| `personal-contact` | real name / phone / company email — also the owner's decision |

**Mixing cohorts in one run is what makes a batch stall.** The open rows finish
in minutes and then everything waits on a person nobody told to be there. Pick
one cohort, run it to the end, then pick the next.

```bash
node scripts/targets-select.mjs --stats                     # cohort x payment matrix
node scripts/targets-select.mjs --unattended --free-only    # the run needing nobody
node scripts/targets-select.mjs --cohort captcha --limit 40 # the next session
node scripts/targets-select.mjs --cohort account --format urls
```

Two details that are easy to get backwards. `captcha-passive` does **not** put a
target in the `captcha` cohort — it clears itself in an ordinary browser and
costs the run nothing; treating it as a challenge pushes open targets into the
queue that needs a person. And `--free-only` keeps `payment: "optional"`,
because a free listing behind a three-month queue is still free — it drops only
`required`.

`gate` (singular) remains the single answer to "what stops me here first",
ranked by **cost**, not by DOM order: a demand for a phone number outranks an
account, which outranks a CAPTCHA. All four values — `gates`, `gate`, `cohort`,
and the ban on `usable` when a human gate exists — are derived in one place,
`scripts/lib-cohort.mjs`, and the validator recomputes them. Deriving a cohort
by hand in a report is how a target reads `account` in the data and `open` in
the plan, which is worse than having no label at all.

## The three guards, each of which exists because it was needed

A generic form driver run across a directory list will, unsupervised, do worse
than nothing — a listing is a permanent public record, and the brand's official
mailbox is attached to it. All three were added after a real batch run did the
wrong thing:

1. **No URL field, no submission.** A directory submission always has one. A
   form without one is something else on the page, and that something else is
   usually a newsletter box — so the alternative to this check is subscribing
   the official address to strangers' mailing lists while reporting it as link
   building. The scorer picked exactly such a form on a live target.
2. **The submit control must read like one.** On another target the "submit
   labels" came back as four product names, meaning the scorer had found page
   buttons rather than the form's own action. A control whose label is not
   submit/send/add/post/next (or the CJK equivalents) is refused, not clicked.
3. **`requestSubmit()` is not a click.** Forms wired to a handler on the
   *button* ignore it, and the page then looks exactly as it does after a silent
   success. Click the real control and confirm against something other than the
   page text.

And the rule that outranks all three: **a generic driver classifies, it does not
certify.** Its `submitted` means the form was accepted, never that a listing
exists — that is `public`, and it needs the anchor seen on a live page.

## Building or extending the target library

```bash
# 1. someone's list → deduped leads
node scripts/third-party-list-ingest.mjs --input THEIR-LIST.md --out .backlink/leads.json

# 2. leads → reachability, real route, earliest gate, price on the page
node scripts/probe-submission-targets.mjs --input .backlink/leads.json \
  --out .backlink/probed.json --concurrency 12 --resume

# 3. fold in (paid rows route themselves into paid-platforms.json).
#    --dropped-out keeps every row the merge did not write, in full, with its
#    reason and evidence — re-probe from that file instead of losing the row.
node scripts/merge-submission-targets.mjs --probe .backlink/probed.json \
  --source-list 'where this came from' --dropped-out .backlink/dropped.json --dry-run

# 4. pick a batch and run it
node scripts/targets-select.mjs --cohort open --free-only
```

Step 2 is anonymous HTTP, so it is honest only about what **is** present. Rows it
cannot resolve come out `unverified` and need a browser or a human before they
mean anything; the merge keeps them out of the target table rather than letting
them pad a count — but **it does not throw them away**. Every dropped row is
printed in full and, with `--dropped-out`, written back out with its reason and
evidence, because `unverified` is a statement about **the probe**: a 403 from a
WAF, a timeout, and a domain that genuinely has no form all produce it. The same
listing covers the `usable` → `gated` downgrade, which the merge *derives* from
the gate set rather than observing, and therefore names as derived.

Since 2026-08-30 step 2 is split in two layers: the probe itself only fetches
and **dumps each domain's raw HTML into `<out>.evidence/<domain>.html`**; the
`status`/`gate`/`cohort`/`kind` on every row come from
`scripts/lib-probe-classifier.mjs` and are **suggestions** (`suggestedBy` on the
row, `suggested: true` inside the classifier output). When a row looks wrong —
a "usable" that gates on step 2, an "unknown" that is obviously a directory —
read the dumped HTML and overrule the suggestion; do not re-run the probe
hoping for a different regex outcome.
